This is a overcook style demo aimed at learning Unity UI system.

In this demo you can pickup items in both hands and interact with several kitchen furniture to make the recipe of your dreams.

You have access to:
- a fridge which generate unlimited items to let you cook as much as you want.
- a magic crates that spawn items at random
- a crates with items
- a worktop that lets you place an item onto it if you need a free hand
- a cutting station that lets you cut your ingredients (the plate behind it is also interactable (press F) and shows you all the items you can cut)
- a stove to cook your steaks
- a kitchen table to actually make your recipes

You also have a recipe book (toggle by pressing TAB) that lets you create your own recipes and then create them by placing all the relevant items onto the kitchen table

The objects you can interact with are highlighted when aimed at, press F to actually initiate the interaction.
Many elements spawn world space canvas to further the interaction with them, this interaction can be canceled by pressing ESC
